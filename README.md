## 💻 About Me

I'm a software engineer with years of experience building backend systems, APIs, and scalable solutions—primarily in the fintech space since 2018. My core strengths lie in:

- TypeScript, Node.js, and Go
- SQL & NoSQL (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Docker & Kubernetes
- Distributed Tracing, Monitoring, and Logging
- CI/CD pipelines & GitOps with ArgoCD

I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, reliable systems that scale well and are easy to maintain.

## 🏃‍♂️ Outside the Code

When I'm not coding, you’ll find me **running by Lake Toba**, chasing my personal goal of logging 1000+ km/year on foot. Running teaches me focus, discipline, and endurance—all things that help me write better code, too.
